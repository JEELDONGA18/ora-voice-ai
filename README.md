## 🔄 Workflow of Ora

Ora follows a structured real-time voice interaction pipeline:

1. User grants microphone access
2. Audio is captured in real time
3. Speech segments are detected
4. AI reasoning via Google Cloud Vertex AI / Gemini
5. Response is generated with context
6. Voice synthesis via ElevenLabs
7. Audio streamed back to the user
8. System states manage errors & interruptions

This ensures a **low-latency, human-like conversational experience**.
